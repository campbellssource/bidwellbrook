### There are lots of ways everyone can help:

### Become a Citizen Science Investigator

Contact us if you would be interested in joining our team of Citizen Scientists. Your role would be to take and analyse monthly water samples from the Bidwell Brook. This will produce data that can be used to target work and identify degrading water bodies and help to spot pollution events so they can be dealt with as quickly as possible. You will be part of a network of catchment communities that are invested in their local environment. Training will be provided. For further details of what’s involved, see Westcountry CSI - Westcountry Rivers Trust (wrt.org.uk)

### Use Water Wisely

We can all do our bit to clean up our environment. South West Water have some great tips and advice for using water: Saving water in your home , garden and at work (southwestwater.co.uk)

### Clean Up Your Act

Do you have a private sewage outlet by the Brook? Please make sure it’s operating correctly and doesn’t discharge into the water. Do you have a problem with farming run-off? If you need help, expert advice or access to funding, contact us and we’ll do our best to support you.

### Sponsor a kit

Water investigation kits cost £35 each, and the contents need to be replenished regularly. If you’d like to help by sponsoring a kit, please contact us and we’ll send you details on how you can easily do this.

### Share Your Ideas

If you’ve got an idea about how we can help to improve the Bidwell Brook, do let us know. From Himalayan balsam clearing to wildlife monitoring, there’s lots we can do, together.
