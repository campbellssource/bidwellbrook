    Home to iconic species including otters, kingfishers and, within living memory, brown trout and even salmon. The Brook rises in Rattery and winds its way through the beautiful Bidwell Valley and Dartington, before entering the River Dart at Totnes. Although the Brook is only 9,489km (just under 6 miles) long, it has a catchment area, including its various tributaries, of 13.107 km2/1310.67 ha.

  text: Whilst it still looks beautiful in many sections, all is not well with this small but important stretch of water. So, concerned local groups and individuals have come together to form the Bidwell Brook Partnership (BBP) to help conserve, nurture and restore this valuable habitat. Our work has become all the more urgent due to the impact of global warming on local flooding, drought and effects on wildlife.
