The Brook (and its valley) supports a wide range of plants and animals, including otters, eels and brown trout. We are aiming to have a full ecological assessment undertaken of the Brook, so we can take appropriate actions to conserve, nurture and maybe enable the return of former inhabitants, such as salmon. We’ll be expanding this section as we develop, but in the meantime, here are a few recent sightings:   _nicola crockford (@numenini) tweeted at 10:20 pm on Wed, May 31, 2023:_ _With thanks to @popmoc, so special to snorkel his delightful stretch of Bidwell Brook, a tributary of the Dart which my Grandmother used to fly fish, in Week. Thrilling to find abundant Brown Trout living there - mostly small & quite shy._ _#MySwim #Dartington #Totnes #Devon_ _nicola crockford (@numenini) tweeted at 10:21 pm on Wed, May 31, 2023:_ _Disappointingly low visibility in Bidwell Brook, but plenty of Gammarus pulex freshwater shrimps - good food for the Trout._ _Saw no other fish species in the 300m stretch we swam._ _Quite a few Caddisfly larvae._ _Sadly, the invasive alien Signal Crayfish is there. #riverflies_
