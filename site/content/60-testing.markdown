Programmes 2023

---------------

### Bacterial Testing

• Testing for Ecoli, enterococcus and total coliforms • 16 week programme over the summer of 2023 • High standard data provided for future action plans **Details:** We are running a water quality testing programme over the summer, in collaboration with Friends of the Dart (FoD). This programme will help us identify and determine the extent and pattern of bacterial contamination in the Brook, particularly from the Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) at Rattery. The data will complement that being obtained by the equivalent testing of the River Dart by FoD and of the lower reaches of the Bidwell Brook by SW Water. It will provide high quality baseline data (comparable to that obtained by the Environment Agency and SW Water) for the proposed BBP Catchment Plan. **How:** Twice weekly monitoring over 16 weeks. **Where:** Sites above and below the CSO at Rattery.  

### Citizen Science Investigations

• Producing data to target work and identify degrading water • Spotting pollution events for quick remedial action • Involving volunteers to help protect our local environment **Details:** We are running Citizen Science Investigations for at least 1 year, working in collaboration with the Westcountry Rivers Trust. We have teams involving over 30 volunteers, doing regular basic water quality testing. This will produce useful data as well as enabling people to learn and engage people with the water environment. The BBP volunteers will join a network of catchment communities that are invested in their local environment. **How:** Monthly monitoring, for a minimum of July 2023-July 2024. **Where:** At various sampling sites along the Bidwell Brook. Our grateful thanks are due to Friends of the Dart and Westcountry Rivers Trust and everyone who has donated to enable/support these testing programmes.
